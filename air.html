            <h2>Understanding the Air Quality Index (AQI)</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>The Air Quality Index (AQI)</b> is a crucial tool for assessing and communicating the quality of
                    the
                    air we breathe. It provides valuable information about the levels of various air pollutants, helping
                    individuals and communities make informed decisions to protect their health. This article explores
                    the
                    aqi, its significance, and how it operates to provide a clear understanding of air quality.

                <br>
                <h2>What is the Air Quality Index (AQI)?</h2>
                <p>The Air Quality Index, commonly known as the aqi, is a standardized scale used to measure and report
                    the
                    quality of the air in a specific location. It quantifies the concentration of various air pollutants
                    in
                    the atmosphere and translates this data into a simple numerical value, making it easier for the
                    public
                    to grasp the severity of air pollution.</p>

                <br>

                <h2>
                    How Does the AQI Work?
                </h2>
                <p>The aqi relies on data collected from air quality monitoring stations strategically located in
                    different
                    areas. These stations continuously measure the concentration of key air pollutants, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Particulate Matter (PM2.5 and PM10): </b>Tiny airborne particles that can be inhaled into the
                        lungs, potentially causing respiratory problems.</li>
                    <li><b>Ground-Level Ozone (O3): </b>Ozone at ground level is a harmful pollutant that can cause
                        breathing difficulties and other health issues.</li>
                    <li><b>Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2):</b> A gas produced by combustion processes that can irritate the
                        respiratory system.</li>
                    <li><b>Sulfur Dioxide (SO2):</b>
                        A gas that can harm the respiratory system and contribute to the formation of acid rain.</li>
                    <li><b>Carbon Monoxide (CO):</b> A colorless, odorless gas that interferes with the body’s ability
                        to transport oxygen.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The aqi considers the concentration levels of these pollutants and calculates a numerical value. This
                    value is then classified into specific color-coded categories, which represent different levels of
                    air quality, ranging from “Good” to “Hazardous.” The higher the aqi value, the worse the air
                    quality.</p>
